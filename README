-------

* install npm (1.1.0-3)
* run "npm install" in the root folder
* run "node app.js"

Notes:
- Everyauth fails to parse Google OAuth response once in a while and causes the server to crash. Workaround for this is to use 'node forever.js' when starting the server which respawns the app once it crashes.
- In order to authenticate with Google, you will need to register a Google App via the Google API Console. The callback endpoint is /auth/google/callback. You will probably need to add your application domain in /etc/hosts to map to localhost.
- To support persistency, you need to install mongodb and create a database called ubuntalk.
- If you want to locally change the default configurations, create a my_config.js file with the following structure which should copy config.js:

        var my_config = {}

        my_config.server = {
            port: 8000
        }

        my_config.app = {
            google_client_id: "525714278869.apps.googleusercontent.com",
            google_client_secret: "bC50ms1M0d52hemY2eYPLeVw"
        }

        module.exports = my_config
