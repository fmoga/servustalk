INSTALL
-------

* install node.js (0.6.9)
* install npm (1.1.0-3)
* run "npm install" in the root folder
* run "node app.js"

Notes:
- Everyauth fails to parse Google OAuth response once in a while and causes the server to crash. Workaround for this is to use 'node forever.js' when starting the server which respawns the app once it crashes.
- In order to authenticate with Google, you will need to register a Google App via the Google API Console. The callback endpoint is /auth/google/callback. You will probably need to add your application domain in /etc/hosts to map to localhost.
